I have a transcript of a YouTube video, and I need your help to create compelling short clips suitable for TikTok and YouTube Shorts. Below is the transcript:

```
```

Please analyze the transcript and identify the most engaging moments. For each selected clip, provide the following details in JSON format:

1. **Title**: A catchy and engaging title that encapsulates the essence of the clip.
2. **Description**: A concise description that highlights the key moments or themes.
3. **Hashtags**: A set of relevant and trending hashtags to enhance discoverability.
4. **Viral Probability**: An estimated likelihood (in percentage) that the clip will go viral, based on its content and appeal.
5. **Timestamp**: The start and end times of the clip in "mm:ss" format, ensuring clips are between 15 to 60 seconds long.

Focus on moments that are likely to capture attention quickly, such as emotional highlights, surprising facts, or humorous segments. The output should be structured as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Engaging Title for Clip 1",
    "description": "A brief summary of Clip 1's content.",
    "hashtags": ["#Example", "#Clip1", "#Viral"],
    "viral_probability": "80%",
    "timestamp": {
      "start": "01:15",
      "end": "01:45"
    }
  },
  {
    "title": "Engaging Title for Clip 2",
    "description": "A brief summary of Clip 2's content.",
    "hashtags": ["#Example", "#Clip2", "#Trending"],
    "viral_probability": "90%",
    "timestamp": {
      "start": "03:05",
      "end": "03:50"
    }
  }
  // Add more clips as needed
]
```

Ensure each clip is crafted to maximize viewer engagement and shareability across short-form video platforms.
